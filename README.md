# image_extractor
Created to extract images from a single folder that may contain many more nested folders (think a Facebook dump).

Run the program, give it a source folder name and a destination folder name (the destination folder should already exist) and let it extract your images.

I made this because if you 'Download Your Data" from social media providers they give you a heaping pile of unorgainzed junk. My wife wanted her images out without a ton of manual labor.
